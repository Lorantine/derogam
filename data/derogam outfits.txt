# Generators
outfit "DGM Blaze Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 709000
	thumbnail "outfit/blaze core"
	"mass" 11
	"outfit space" -11
	"energy generation" 1.9
	"heat generation" 4.9
	"energy capacity" 400
	"shield generation" .045
	"shield energy" .045
	description `While its design may not suggest it, the Blaze Core was developed not too long ago to both satisfy the demand for an even smaller reactor and to enable a size increase for others of its lineage.`

outfit "DGM Ember Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 1856000
	thumbnail "outfit/ember core"
	"mass" 25
	"outfit space" -25
	"energy generation" 4.4
	"heat generation" 11.6
	"energy capacity" 900
	"shield generation" .11
	"shield energy" .11
	description `For a long time, this generator served as the backbone of all smaller ships in Derogam space. Due to recent technological advancements, it was made slightly bigger and more powerful after an even smaller version was developed.`

outfit "DGM Flame Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 4837000
	thumbnail "outfit/flame core"
	"mass" 57
	"outfit space" -57
	"energy generation" 10.5
	"heat generation" 26.7
	"energy capacity" 2100
	"shield generation" .24
	"shield energy" .24
	description `Throughout the centuries, the Derogam generators changed drastically, but every new generation has always been based on modifications on this very generator. This means that some traces of older generations could still be found in its inner design, however small.`

outfit "DGM Inferno Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 8506000
	thumbnail "outfit/inferno core"
	"mass" 90
	"outfit space" -90
	"energy generation" 17.45
	"heat generation" 43.15
	"energy capacity" 3300
	"shield generation" .38
	"shield energy" .38
	description `This generator is a staple for both smaller ships that barely manage to fit it in, and larger ships that pair it with other generators. Even though larger ships are usually better off with a bigger generator, merchant captains often prefer a cheaper version, due to the limited amount of combat they may face.`

outfit "DGM Magma Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 12968000
	thumbnail "outfit/magma core"
	"mass" 123
	"outfit space" -123
	"energy generation" 25.1
	"heat generation" 60.65
	"energy capacity" 4550
	"shield generation" .53
	"shield energy" .53
	description `Most larger warships simply can't function properly without a generator of this caliber. While recently its demand went down due to an even bigger version based on it, the Magma Core still serves as the backbone of most medium-large ships.`

outfit "DGM Searing Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 18861000
	thumbnail "outfit/searing core"
	"mass" 162
	"outfit space" -162
	"energy generation" 34.7
	"heat generation" 82.2
	"energy capacity" 6250
	"shield generation" .67
	"shield energy" .67
	description `With the development of both the Guardian warship and a new line of generators, there was a huge demand amongst captains of such large ships for a new, even bigger generator to power its systems. Rumor has it that it was developed in only a fifth of the time it took to create the generator it was based on.`

# Cooling
outfit "DGM Cooling Coil Araw"
	plural "DGM Cooling Coils Araw"
	category "Systems"
	cost 168000
	thumbnail "outfit/cooling coil size 1"
	"mass" 6
	"outfit space" -6
	"cooling" 3.2
	"active cooling" 12.4
	"cooling energy" .95
	description `The concept of the newest line of Derogam cooling is a combination of powerful bulk cooling and the new "smart cooling" system. It uses energy to distribute the heat to all surfaces to raise efficiency drastically when ships get close to overheating.`

outfit "DGM Cooling Coil Deer"
	plural "DGM Cooling Coils Deer"
	category "Systems"
	cost 451000
	thumbnail "outfit/cooling coil size 2"
	"mass" 14
	"outfit space" -14
	"cooling" 8.9
	"active cooling" 30.4
	"cooling energy" 2.2
	description `When the new smart cooling system proved to be quite effective, the new models quickly became an integral part of Derogam spaceflight. It features a similar orb as the generators, working in reverse to absorb heat using power, instead of generating power and producing heat.`

outfit "DGM Cooling Coil Epicia"
	plural "DGM Cooling Coils Epicia"
	category "Systems"
	cost 1122000
	thumbnail "outfit/cooling coil size 3"
	"mass" 31
	"outfit space" -31
	"cooling" 23.6
	"active cooling" 69.5
	"cooling energy" 4.75
	description `While the largest ships may not have enough cooling with just one of these, it ensures all but the largest ships can function without any risk of overheating. The design itself became very tall to maximize surface area, so creating a larger more efficient version seems highly unlikely.`
